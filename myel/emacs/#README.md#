#EMACS Integration

##Requirements
* You must have the [auto-complete](https://github.com/auto-complete/auto-complete) package.
And [yasnippet](https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet) package is recommended.
* Make sure dcd-client and dcd-server is in your exec-path. Otherwise, please set the variable ```dcd-exectutable``` and ```dcd-server-executable``` using ```M-x customize```.

## Setup
* First, follow the Setup section in the root README.
* Second, add the following to your .emacs. With this setting, dcd-server starts automatically when you open file in d-mode.
```
;;; ac-dcd
(add-to-list 'load-path "path_to_ac-dcd.el")
(require 'ac-dcd)
(add-to-list 'ac-modes 'd-mode)

(add-hook 'd-mode-hook
		  '(lambda () "set up ac-dcd"
			 (ac-dcd-maybe-start-server)
			 (add-to-list 'ac-sources 'ac-source-dcd)))
(add-to-list 'popwin:special-display-config '("*dcd-output*"))

(define-key d-mode-map (kbd "C-c ?") 'ac-dcd-popup-ddoc-at-point)
(define-key d-mode-map (kbd "C-c .") 'ac-dcd-goto-definition)
(define-key d-mode-map (kbd "C-c ,") 'ac-dcd-goto-def-pop-marker)
```

* Third, set import path using ```M-x customize-variable RET ac-dcd-flags```.
* When something is wrong, please check variables with ```M-x customize-apropos RET ac-dcd``` and restart server with ```M-x ac-dcd-init-server```.
