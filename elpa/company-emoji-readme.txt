company-mode backend providing autocompletion for emoji. üÜíüí¶

### setup

Add `company-emoji.el` to your load-path, then add something like the
following to your init file (`company-emoji-init` doesn‚Äôt start
company-mode):

(require 'company-emoji)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'company-mode)
(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'company-emoji-init)

After selecting an emoji-word from the completion-list, it will be
replaced by the real unicode emoji (`:cactus:` becomes üåµ, `:cat:`
becomes üê±, etc.)

### emoji font support

#### mac os

If you‚Äôre using the cocoa version of Emacs (i.e., if built
 `‚Äê-with-ns`, or `--with-cocoa` using Homebrew), you‚Äôll need to add
 something like this to your init file (thanks [@waymondo](https://github.com/waymondo)!):

```elisp
(defun darwin-set-emoji-font (frame)
"Adjust the font settings of FRAME so Emacs NS/Cocoa can display emoji properly."
  (if (eq system-type 'darwin)
    (set-fontset-font t 'symbol (font-spec :family "Apple Color Emoji") frame 'prepend)))
For when emacs is started with Emacs.app
(darwin-set-emoji-font nil)
Hook for when a cocoa frame is created with emacsclient
see https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Creating-Frames.html
(add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'darwin-set-emoji-font)
```

#### linux

Linux users will need to replace ‚ÄúApple Color Emoji‚Äù with an available
font with emoji support, such as
[Symbola](https://zhm.github.io/symbola/) (thanks to
[@syohex](https://github.com/syohex) for figuring this out for their
[emoji backend for auto-complete](https://github.com/syohex/emacs-ac-emoji#linux-users)).
Symbola can be installed with `apt-get`:

```sh
apt-get install ttf-ancient-fonts
```

**NB:** The `set-fontset-font` function is apparently only available
 when Emacs has been compiled with a window system.

### custom variables

#### aliases

You can add shortcode aliases by modifying `company-emoji-aliases`.
Run `M-x customize-variable [RET] company-emoji-aliases` to bring up
company-emoji‚Äôs customization pane, then add or remove aliases to your
taste:

Hide Company Emoji Aliases:
[INS] [DEL] Symbol: :man-woman-boy:
            String: :family:
[INS] [DEL] Symbol: :woman-kiss-man:
            String: :couplekiss:
[INS] [DEL] Symbol: :woman_man_holding_hands:
            String: :couple:
[INS] [DEL] Symbol: :woman-heart-man:
            String: :couple_with_heart:
[INS] [DEL] Symbol: :oop:
            String: :speak_no_evil:
[INS]

(‚ÄúSymbol‚Äù designates the user-defined alias, and ‚Äústring‚Äù designates
the original shortcode you want your alias to mimick.)

#### unicode replacement

By default, `:cat:` is replaced with üê± upon completion, but that can
be turned off by setting the variable `company-emoji-insert-unicode`
to `nil`.
